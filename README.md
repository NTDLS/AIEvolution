# AIEvolution
A multi-generational rule-based evolution simulator based on trait specialization using neural networks to drive behavior.

This was my original simulator using GDI+ and C++, the current C# simulator is called AIVolution and can be found at [AIVolution](https://github.com/NTDLS/AIVolution).
